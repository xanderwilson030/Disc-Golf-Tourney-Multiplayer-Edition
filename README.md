# Disc Golf Tourney Multiplayer Edition
 
A complete remake from the ground up of one of my first projects: an arcade disc golf game. Designed for over-the-internet multiplayer, this project was my first time doing network programming using Photon (PUN 2.0) for Unity. I designed the game to be client-authoritative, and you can play by yourself or with up to four players.
